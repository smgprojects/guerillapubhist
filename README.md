The idea is to use Librarybox as a way of surprising visitors to a historic site with a layer of 'counternarrative'. Perhaps it's a silly idea, but I want them to encounter this counternarrative by finding materials on the map, then trying to find the space in the real world. Then perhaps the chat/filesharing to record their own encounters. So the librarybox becomes part of the history of engagement at the site as well.

Maptiles: made with mobile atlas creator. Clunky. Must be a better way of doing this. Possible to add historical georectified maps, provided you can sort out transparency.
